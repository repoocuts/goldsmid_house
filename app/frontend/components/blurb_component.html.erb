				I'm a Ruby on Rails engineer and strategic communications consultant, currently based in Lisbon, Portugal, operating across the global tech sector for more than 10 years through Goldsmid House, a UK registered limited company.
				<br>
				With almost a decade of experience as an engineer I have developed and maintained large-scale commercial software in a diverse range of industries including fintech, education, art and logistics.
				<br>
				I like working with organisations who try and impose a positive impact on society. I have lived across Europe and Africa and travelled to many further away places.
				<br>
				I enjoy building good products and even better teams, and I firmly believe that the latter makes the former inevitable. I am equally at home in the fast paced world of a growing start up, or embedded within a team of larger and, more complex, organisations.
				<br>
				Thanks to my different commercial backgrounds, I bring a blend of technical and business acumen and am comfortable with client facing roles. I really value patience, trust and kindness in the work place, and I aim to bring exactly that in all that I do.
				<br>
				Outside of engineering, I'm a keen footballer (soccer if that's your preference), skier and rather terrible, yet enthusiastic oenophile.
